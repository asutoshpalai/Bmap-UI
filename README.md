# Bmap-UI

This is a windows phone app which hepls to locate our friends and others who want to share 
their location.
This is a very simple and easy to use app.

Main Features are:

1. In app sign in

2. Setting your own privacy and changing it anytime you want!!

3. Easy to use UI 

4. Uses Bing Map API

5. Code is in HTML and Javascript

This app needs a online backend which is at :
https://github.com/tnmy44/BMap

To use this code load it into Microsoft Visual Studio, with Windows Phone SDK,
Bing Maps SDK for Windows Store apps.

The most important part is the use of Bing Maps API. It has a working version of Bing Maps API for Windows Phone app developed using javascript and HTML5. This could be of help to many since there is no proper online solution to 
get it work. Details of this will be shared on my  Blog.

This was a collaborative project bewtween me and three of my friends 
for code.fun.do, a 24-hours windows app development competion organised by Microsoft Corporation.

Both project was developed in great hurry, so you will find both of them
containg very less comments and documentaions, particularly in UI.
We will try to document it in future.
